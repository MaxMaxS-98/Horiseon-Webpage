## Description

- When i saw the code for this website it was all wrapped up with div elements,so i changed that, that way the code looks cleaner and easier to read.
- I also noticed that the img didn't have the alt attribute, So I fixed that for people who use screen reader.
- And last I made sure the links are clickable and direct to the right part of the website.
